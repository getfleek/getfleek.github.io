        related facilities and services offered from time to time on Fleek currently or in the future, where such
        services can
        be accessed via the internet either on mobile and desktop/laptop (“Fleek” or “App”). As part of subscription
        management,
        any request (cancellation/upgrade) placed by the user will be worked upon within a turnaround time of 3 working
        days.</p>
      <br>
      <p>By accessing and using our Services (defined below), you (“Our User”) are agreeing to these terms and
        conditions
        contained hereinafter (“Terms of Service” or “Terms”). We, Fleek Technologies Private Limited, including its
        affiliates
        & subsidiaries, strongly urge you to read the Terms of Service in detail before registering, accessing or using
        the App
        Services. Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity or
        promotion or new feature and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable
        Services. Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of
        the
        applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect
        to the
        applicable Services. Your use of App Services will be considered as your acceptance of the supplemental terms.
        We
        strongly recommend you read the supplemental terms for each service given below or within the App from time to
        time.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We may amend the Terms at any time by posting an updated version on the App. The updated version of these Terms
        shall
        supersede the previous version of the Terms and take effect immediately upon posting and may be notified, via
        the App.
        You have the right to opt-out of agreeing to these Terms or any future updated version of the Terms, and
        therefore also
        using the App. If you are not comfortable with any of the Terms or do not wish to be bound by the same, you are
        at
        liberty to refrain from using the App and the App Services. However, please be aware that your continued use of
        the App
        Services for a period of 7 (seven) days from the launch of any updated Terms would mean deemed acceptance of

        should be read contemporaneously with the Terms of Use. Illegality or unenforceability of one or more provisions
        of
        these Terms of Use shall not affect the legality and enforceability of the other terms of the Terms of Use. For
        avoidance of doubt, if any of the provisions becomes void or unenforceable, the rest of the provisions of these
        Terms of
        Use shall be binding upon the User.</p>
